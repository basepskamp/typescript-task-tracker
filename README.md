# TypeScript Task Tracker

Task List tracker written where you can add/edit/delete tasks and give them a due date.

Techniques used:
- Vue3
- Vite
- Typescript
- Typescript
- Tailwind (supports dark and light mode preference)

The code structure showcases the atomic components approach. This can be overkill for a small application like this but 
will be proper scalable in terms of further development and maintenance and keeps everything nice and seperated.
